[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:TAIL_FEATHER_TISSUE_LAYERS]
This command creates tissue layers using tissue token HAIR on every bodypart that has category HEAD.  Categories are strings you type up in the bodypart raws.  The number is a thickness.  You can also place a position or relation token after the thickness, but it isn't required.  You can put multiple tissue layers in each command.  Each one starts with a group token (BY_CATEGORY, BY_TYPE, BY_TOKEN).
